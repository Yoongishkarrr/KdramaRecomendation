## Kdrama Recommendation Bot
The Kdrama Recommendation Bot is a Telegram bot designed to provide users with Korean drama (Kdrama) recommendations based on their preferred genre. Whether you're into Romance, Melodrama, Historical, Thriller, Action, or Comedy, this bot has got you covered with tailored suggestions.

## Features
Welcome Message: Greets new users and asks for their name to personalize the interaction.
Genre Selection: Users can choose from a list of genres to get recommendations that suit their taste.
Personalized Recommendations: Based on the selected genre, the bot provides a list of Kdramas complete with a brief description and a link to where users can watch them.
## Future Updates
Expanded Drama Lists: We plan to continually update and expand our list of dramas to include more genres and titles, ensuring users have access to the latest and most popular Kdramas.
Additional Features: I am also working on adding new features to enhance user experience and interaction with the bot
## How It Works
User Interaction: The bot starts by asking the user's name and then prompts them to select their preferred genre.
Processing Request: Once the genre is selected, the bot fetches a list of Kdramas from its database that matches the user's preference.
Delivering Recommendations: The bot sends the user a message containing the recommendations, including the drama title, a short description, and a link to more information.

Go (Golang): The primary programming language used for developing the bot.
